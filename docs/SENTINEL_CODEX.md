## 🤖 BRAND VOICE - "THE CALM INTELLIGENCE"

### Voice Implementation

✅ **Normal State**: Analytical, serene
- "All systems synchronized."
- "Network stability at 99.97%"
- "Awaiting network traffic data."

}
```

**Status**: Code written, commented out (requires audio files)

**To Enable**:
1. Add audio files to `/static/sounds/`
2. Uncomment audio section in `script.js`
