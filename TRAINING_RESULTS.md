- **F1-Score**: 10.00%
- **False Positive Rate**: 0.62% ✅ (Target: ≤10%)

## Analysis & Observations

### Strengths:
1. ✅ **Model Training**: Excellent convergence and low reconstruction loss
2. ✅ **Low False Positive Rate**: Successfully kept FPR below 10% target
3. ✅ **No Tensor Shape Errors**: All data preprocessing handled correctly
4. ✅ **Model Persistence**: Successfully saved and loaded in Keras format
5. ✅ **Stable Training**: No signs of overfitting or numerical instability

### Challenges:
1. ❌ **Low Detection Rate**: Only 5.41% (far below 85% target)
2. ⚠️ **Mock Data Limitations**: Simulated data may not have realistic anomaly patterns
3. ⚠️ **Class Imbalance**: 80% benign vs 20% malicious in dataset

### Root Cause Analysis:

The low detection rate is primarily due to:

1. **Mock Data Characteristics**:
   - Simulated malicious traffic may be too similar to benign traffic after normalization
   - Real IoT attacks have more complex behavioral patterns not captured in mock data
   - The autoencoder learned to reconstruct both benign and malicious patterns well

2. **Autoencoder Behavior**:
   - The model successfully learned to compress and reconstruct the data
   - However, it doesn't distinguish well between normal and anomalous patterns
   - This is expected with simplified mock data

3. **Threshold Selection**:
   - More aggressive thresholds (lower values) increase detection but also increase FPR
   - Trade-off between detection rate and false positive rate is difficult with current data

## Recommendations for Improvement

### For Production Deployment:

1. **Use Real IoT-23 Dataset**:
   - Download full IoT-23 dataset from https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23
   - Real attack patterns will provide better feature separation
   - Expected detection rate improvement: 70-95%

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Add more behavioral features: connection duration, packet rates, protocol distribution
   - Include temporal features: time of day, day of week
   - Add statistical features: variance, skewness of traffic patterns

3. **Training Improvements**:
   - Train only on benign data (pure autoencoder approach)
   - Use semi-supervised learning techniques
   - Implement ensemble methods with multiple models

4. **Threshold Optimization**:
   - Use validation set for threshold tuning
   - Implement dynamic thresholds based on traffic patterns
   - Consider per-device or per-protocol thresholds

5. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Try Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for better anomaly scoring
   - Implement attention mechanisms in LSTM
   - Use GANs for anomaly detection
