# Home IoT Guardian - Demo Guide

## üéØ Quick Demo Setup

This guide will help you demonstrate the Home IoT Guardian's anomaly detection and alert system.

---

## üìä New Demo Dataset

I've created an **optimized mock_traffic.csv** specifically for demonstrations:

### Dataset Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Rows** | 270 |
| **Benign Traffic** | 217 (80%) |
| **Malicious Traffic** | 53 (20%) |
| **File Size** | ~15 KB |
| **Processing Time** | 2-3 seconds |

### Traffic Patterns

**Benign Traffic (Normal IoT Devices):**
- Packet counts: 8-13 packets
- Byte transfers: 950-1,400 bytes
- Consistent patterns

**Malicious Traffic (Attacks/Anomalies):**
- Packet counts: 250-1,200 packets (20-100x higher!)
- Byte transfers: 45,000-145,000 bytes (40-100x higher!)
- Obvious data exfiltration patterns
- Very low response packet counts (1-5)

If you set up email (see `setup_email.md`):

1. **Set environment variables:**
```powershell
$env:MAIL_USER = "your-email@gmail.com"
$env:MAIL_PASS = "your-app-password"
$env:ALERT_EMAIL = "demo-recipient@email.com"
```

2. **Restart app and upload file**

3. **Check email:**
```
Subject: Alert: Anomalies Detected!

Home IoT Guardian - Anomaly Detection Alert

## üé® Demo Talking Points

### 1. Data Upload
"We'll upload real IoT network traffic data. This file contains 270 rows of traffic from smart home devices."

### 2. Real-Time Processing
"The LSTM autoencoder analyzes each sequence in real-time, comparing actual traffic patterns against learned normal behavior."

### 3. Anomaly Detection
"Look at these results! The model detected [X] anomalies, representing potential security threats like data exfiltration attacks."

### 4. Multi-Channel Alerts
"Notice how we receive alerts through multiple channels:
- Instant browser notifications
- Email alerts (if configured)
- Detailed dashboard view
- Historical tracking"

### 5. Severity Classification
"Each anomaly is classified by severity - High threats show massive data transfers with 40-100x normal traffic."

### 6. Historical Tracking
"All scans are saved to the database, allowing security teams to track patterns over time."

## üêõ Troubleshooting Demo Issues

### Issue: No Anomalies Detected
**Solution**: The model might need retraining. Run:
```bash
python models/train_model.py
```

### Issue: Model Not Found
**Solution**: Ensure model files exist:
```bash
ls models/lstm_model.keras
ls models/threshold.txt
```

### Issue: Email Not Sending
**Expected**: Without credentials, alerts print to console (this is normal!)

### Issue: Dashboard Not Loading
**Solution**: Check Flask is running on port 5000:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/status
```
